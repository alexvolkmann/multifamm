# multiFAMM

This package provides an implementation for multivariate functional additive mixed models (multiFAMM), see Volkmann et al. (2021, <arXiv:2103.06606>). It builds on developed methods for univariate sparse functional regression models and multivariate functional principal component analysis. 

This package contains the function to run a multiFAMM and some convenience functions useful when working with large models. A development version of this package can be found on GitHub (alexvolkmann/multifamm). An additional package on GitHub contains more convenience functions to reproduce the analyses of the corresponding paper (alexvolkmann/multifammPaper).
