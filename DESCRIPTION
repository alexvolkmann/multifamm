Description: An implementation for multivariate functional additive mixed
    models (multiFAMM), see Volkmann et al. (2021, <arXiv:2103.06606>). It builds on developed methods for univariate sparse 
    functional regression models and multivariate functional principal component
    analysis. This package contains the function to run a multiFAMM and some
    convenience functions useful when working with large models. An additional 
    package on GitHub contains more convenience functions to reproduce the 
    analyses of the corresponding paper (alexvolkmann/multifammPaper).
